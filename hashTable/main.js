//hash table = key value pairs
//create own hash table
//use hash function

//hash table = acts like a translator, taking an input of any size (key) and converting it into fixed size value
//(hash code) that can be used as an index within the hash table's internal array. the process of mapping arbitrary keys
//to fixed length indices is called hashing.
